# Textbooks for Computer Science Courses

This is a crowd-sourced database of required textbooks for CSE classes at SUNY Korea. Most of the textbooks were downloaded at [SBU Textbook PDF Masterlist](https://sbutextbook.github.io/#CSE).

## :books: Downloading

You can download materials by cloning the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/computing-society/computer-science-textbooks.git
```

Otherwise, you can download the packaged zip file under `Releases` tab.

## Contributing

Making a pull request would require you to download the entire repository, which is inefficient and inconvenient. Therefore, we will work on building something where you can easily upload files. Until then, this is the only way.
