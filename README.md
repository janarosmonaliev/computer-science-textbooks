# Textbooks for Computer Science Courses

This is a crowd-sourced database of required textbooks for CSE classes at SUNY Korea. Most of the textbooks were downloaded from [SBU Textbook PDF Masterlist](https://sbutextbook.github.io/#CSE).

## :books: Downloading 

:warning: It is not advised to use git to fetch the entire repository

```diff
- git clone https://github.com/computing-society/computer-science-textbooks.git
```

Instead, download the packaged zip file under `Releases` tab.

## Contributing

Making a pull request would require you to download the entire repository, which is inefficient and inconvenient. Therefore, we will work on building something where you can easily upload files. Until then, this is the only way.
